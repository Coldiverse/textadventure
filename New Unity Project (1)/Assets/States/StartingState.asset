    what they call a brain.


    Well son you may not know me, but I''m always there,
    just trying to help you out with your decision here. Anyway, there isn''t much
    of an option here but to decide how to kill them really.


    What do you want
    to do?

    1. Take them all head on with a knife

    2. Toss a grenade or some
    other explosive.'
